# Context

Context is a community protocol that allows components to share data without having to pass it down through the component tree. This is particularly useful for global state management, where multiple components need access to the same data.

While implemented in Lit and other frameworks, it is not yet a web components standard.

Please refer the sources provided below for more information on how to implement context in your web components.
