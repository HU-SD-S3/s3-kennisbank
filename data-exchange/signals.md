# Signals

Signals are a new way of handling data changes in web components. They are similar to observables, but with a more lightweight and efficient implementation. Signals allow components to react to data changes without the need for complex event handling or state management.
They are a proposed standard by the TC39 committee, which is responsible for the development of JavaScript.
Signals are not yet a standard in the web components specification, but they are already implemented in some frameworks like angular, react and lit.

Please refer to the sources provided below for more information on how to implement signals in your web components.
