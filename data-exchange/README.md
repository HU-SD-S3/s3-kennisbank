# Data Exchange

In this chapter we will discuss the different ways of exchanging data, when using web components. It's important to
understand the different data exchange solutions, so you can choose the right one for your use case and to prevent
problems like manually reloading the page to see changes in the data.

The first article in this chapter will discuss the data exchange between front- and back-end and the setup of our
reference architecture for the front-end. The other articles of this chapter will discuss the data exchange between
different components within the front-end itself. All articles are based on a
[project setup](../lit-web-components/project-setup.md) as described in chapter about the Lit Web Components.
