# E2E Testing

TODO: Talk about end-to-end testing for frontend applications, what the difference is with unit testing, and that there
are many libraries for this purpose (cypress, puppetier, playwright, ...).  
TODO: Explain that Unit testing can't see whats going on in the browser, so we need to use a different tool for that.  
TODO: Talk about headless browsers and how they are used for testing.  
TODO: Talk about playwright; how to set it up, and how to use it (codegen).  
TODO: Talk about plugins for playwright (e.g., for a11y testing).  
TODO: Talk again that you can use a json file with test data to test your application.
