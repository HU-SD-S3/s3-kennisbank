## Vanilla Web Components

Setup a new project for these learning stories. See the [project setup page](project-setup.md) for more information.

The overall learning story for this path is:

_As a developer, I want to understand how to create custom elements using vanilla JavaScript, so that I can create reusable components that are not dependent on any framework._

To achive this, we will cover the following topics:

### Custom Elements

- _As a developer, I want to create a simple custom element that displays "Hello World", so that I can understand the basics of custom elements._ [[Hello World](./hello-world.md)]
- _As a developer, I want to create a simple custom element that displays a message that contains the value of an attribute, so that I can understand how to pass attributes to custom elements._ [[Hello Attribute](./hello-attribute.md)]

### ShadowDOM

- _As a developer, I want to understand how to use the Shadow DOM to encapsulate the styles of a custom element, so that I can create custom elements that are not affected by the styles of the parent document._ [[Hello ShadowDOM](./hello-shadowdom.md)]

### Lifecycle

- _As a developer, I want to understand the lifecycle callbacks of a custom element, so that I can perform actions at different stages of the element's lifecycle._ [[Lifecycle Callbacks](./lifecycle-callbacks.md)]
