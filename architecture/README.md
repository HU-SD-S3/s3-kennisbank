# Architecture

In this chapter, we will explore the architecture of a web application.
Understanding the architecture is crucial for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient applications. We will start with the architecture we can derive from the UX design and then move on to the architectural patterns that help us to structure our codebase effectively.
We finish with the global architecture that goes into organizing the application as a whole.
