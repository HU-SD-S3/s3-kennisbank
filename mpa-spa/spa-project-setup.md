# Single Page Application (SPA) project setup

Single Page Applications (SPAs) are web applications that load a single HTML page and dynamically update the content as the user interacts with the app. This approach allows for a more fluid user experience, similar to that of a desktop application.
Unlike traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs), SPAs do not require a full page reload for each interaction, which can lead to faster navigation and a more seamless experience.
However, SPAs also come with their own set of challenges, such as managing browser history, handling deep linking, and ensuring that the application is SEO-friendly.
In this section, we will discuss how to set up a SPA project using Lit.
To archive this, we need a some code to determine what page to show and to manipulate the DOM to show that page. This is called routing.
We will first setup a simple SPA project to understand the [basics of routing](./routing-basics.md), and then will use the [vaadin router](./vaadin-router.md) library to help us with the routing.
